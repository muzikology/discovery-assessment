# discovery-assessment

This is an interstella service used to find the shortest distance between Planets.
I have uploaded an xlsx file for sample data and one can use swagger ui to view and query the service.
The project can be run using maven with the cmd:
mvn spring-boot:run

The endpoints for service calls can be accessed on Swagger with this URL:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
