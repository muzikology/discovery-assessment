# discovery-assessment

This is an interstella service used to find the shortest distance between Planets.
I have uploaded an xlsx file for sample data and one can use swagger ui to view and query the service.
You need to run mvn install to install dependecies.
The project can be run using maven with the cmd:
mvn spring-boot:run

The endpoints for service calls can be accessed on Swagger with this URL:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
